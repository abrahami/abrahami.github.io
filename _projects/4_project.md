The Hebrew Twitter project is an ongoing effort of my Ph.D. laboratory (<a href="https://www.naslab.ise.bgu.ac.il/">NASLB</a>). This endeavor encompasses the extensive collection of Hebrew Twitter data since 2018, resulting in a substantial corpus of approximately 400 million Tweets. Spearheading the data collection initiative is <a href="https://twitter.com/neuomer?lang=en">Omer Neu</a>, a dedicated Master's student affiliated with the NASLAB. 

I am involved in some of the efforts of this project, dealing with Hebrew NLP and general machine-learning research questions. I use <b>natural language processing (NLP) as well as social network analysis (SNA)</b> tools while working on this project.

Some of the efforts I take part in, related to this project:
