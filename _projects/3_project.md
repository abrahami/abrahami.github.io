The r/place experiment was launched by Reddit on April Fools’ Day, 2017. A shared white canvas of one million pixels (1000 x 1000) appeared in a new subreddit called r/place. Redditors could select any pixel and change its color. Every change was reflected on the shared canvas, thus viewed by all participants.

Once a Redditor recolored a pixel, he was automatically blocked by the system for some random time (5–20 minutes), effectively <b>preventing a single Redditor from having any significant or lasting effect on the canvas</b>. Naturally, this encouraged Redditors to collaborate with others, as mentioned in the r/place subreddit guidelines: <i>'Individually you can create something. Together you can create something more'</i>.

The experiment allows us to focus on various research directions:
<ul>
    <li>Engagement level of online communities.</li>
    <li>Success level of online communities.</li>
    <li>Engagement level of online users.</li>
    <li>Conflicts and collaborations of online communities.</li>

        <p class="card-text">After countless requests from Redditors since the big hype around 2017 r/place, Reddit launched a similar experiment on April 2022. <br>The experiment is similar to the 2017 one.
        However, the launching of the event was announced in advance and the canvas was expanded twice during the experiment. The r/place 2022 was a huge success and demonstrated the power of online users and communities.</p>
