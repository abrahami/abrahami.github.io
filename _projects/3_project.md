The r/place experiment was launched by Reddit on April Fools’ Day, 2017. A shared white canvas of one million pixels (1000 x 1000) appeared in a new subreddit called r/place. Redditors could select any pixel and change its color. Every change was reflected on the shared canvas, thus viewed by all participants.

Once a Redditor recolored a pixel, he was <b>automatically blocked</b> by the system for some random time (5–20 minutes), effectively preventing a single Redditor from having any significant or lasting effect on the canvas. Naturally, this encouraged Redditors to collaborate with others, as mentioned in the r/place subreddit guidelines: <i>'Individually you can create something. Together you can create something more'</i>.
