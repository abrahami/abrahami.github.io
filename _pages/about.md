My name is Abraham Israeli, some call me Avrahami as a nick name. I am a data scientist with research and industry experience of 10+ years. My professional focus lies in the field of machine learning research, particularly within the realm of <b>computational social science</b>.

Currently, I am a post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Michigan. I am hosted by <a href="https://www.dromero.org/">Prof. Daniel Romero</a> and <a href="https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/">Prof. David Jurgens</a> at the School of Information (UMSI). I obtained my Ph.D. from the Ben Gurion University of the Negev, where I was advised by <b>Dr. Oren Tsur</b> and was part of the Natural Language Processing and Social Dynamics lab (<a href="https://www.naslab.ise.bgu.ac.il/">NASLB</a>).

Before starting my current post-doctoral program, I was a Research Fellow at <b>the Data Science Institute</b> (<a href="https://www.runi.ac.il/en/research-institutes/business/dsi/">DSI</a>), Reichman University. I led research projects associated with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Social Analytics. I managed teams of 6-10 researchers, most of whom are undergraduate and master's students. These projects are strongly related to my Ph.D. research field.

Before embarking on my academic path, I gained 8+ years of professional experience at <b>IBM Research and Intel</b>. At Intel, I led a team of 6-8 engineers in the field of data science, overseeing multiple projects and engaging in research activities.

Although I am researching social media platforms, I am not too active on those ðŸ˜Š. However, you can find me on [LinkeIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avrahami-israeli/).
