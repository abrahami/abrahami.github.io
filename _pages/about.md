My name is Abraham Israeli, although those familiar with me refer to me as <b> Avrahami</b>. My professional focus lies in the field of data science research, particularly within the realm of computational social science.

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Ben Gurion University of the Negev, advised by Dr. Oren Tsur. I am a member of the Natural Language Processing and Social Dynamics lab (<a href="https://www.naslab.ise.bgu.ac.il/">NASLB</a>) within the Software and Information Systems Engineering department (<a href="https://in.bgu.ac.il/en/engn/sise/ennew/Pages/default.aspx">SISE</a>).

Alongside my Ph.D. studies, I am a Research Fellow at the Data Science Institute (<a href="https://www.runi.ac.il/en/research-institutes/business/dsi/">DSI</a>), Reichman University. I lead research projects associated with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Social Analytics. I manage teams of 6-10 researchers, most of whom are undergraduate and master's students. These projects are strongly related to my Ph.D. research field.

Although I am researching social media platforms, I am not too active on those ðŸ˜Š. However, you can find me on [LinkeIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avrahami-israeli/).
